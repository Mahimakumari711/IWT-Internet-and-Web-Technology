    <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a cornerstone technology in web development that defines the presentation and layout of HTML documents. 
    While HTML provides the structure and content of a webpage, CSS is responsible for its visual styling, including colors, fonts, spacing, and overall design. 
    This separation of content and design enhances maintainability and scalability in web projects.

CSS operates on the principle of cascading, where styles are applied based on specificity, inheritance, and source order. 
This allows developers to define rules that can be reused across multiple pages, ensuring consistency and reducing redundancy.</p>
